# Cartan-ProjConnection-1937
Translation of Part II of Elie Cartan's 1934-1935 Lectures on The Theory of Spaces with Projective Connection.

This is a translation of Part II of Elie Cartan's 1934-1935 Lectures on The Theory of Spaces with Projective Connection, published by Gauthier-Villars in 1937. 

My translation is currently incomplete. I shall add more sections and chapters as I get round to translating them.

Part I of these lectures deals with Differential Projective Geometry. My translation of Part I is complete, and I have published it on GitHub in a repository called Cartan-ProjDiffGeom-1937.

I am happy to receive suggestions for improving the translation. I have tried to preserve the wording of the original as closely as English idiom allows and have deliberately steered away from a free "dynamic" translation. The danger of "dynamic" translation is that the translator is in danger of infusing his translation with his own misconceptions rather than reporting accurately what Cartan actually said.
